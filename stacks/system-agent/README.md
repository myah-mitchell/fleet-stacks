# System Stack (Agent) Overview

The standard per-VM bundle. Every VM in the fleet runs this one stack, and it is
the only stack most VMs run besides whatever that VM exists to host.

It does four jobs.

Traefik terminates TLS for that VM's own services and puts them behind the
Authentik auth chain, without needing tf01 to be involved. traefik-kop publishes
a router into tf01's shared Redis, but only for a service that also carries a
`kop-public.traefik.*` label, so reaching the wider network is a per-service
choice rather than a per-VM one.

vmagent, vlagent, vector and cadvisor are the VM's telemetry. Between them they
cover the host's own metrics from Node Exporter, per-container metrics from
cadvisor, Traefik's metrics and access log, and the host's journald, syslog and
file logs. Everything is written to ci01's VictoriaMetrics backend.

dockns keeps the VM's DNS records in step with the containers running on it.

dozzle-agent exposes this VM's container logs to a central Dozzle on port 7007.

Deploy it only once ci01, id01 and pk01 exist: it writes metrics to ci01, uses
id01 for the auth chain, and takes its Traefik certificate from pk01. Before
those are up, traefik-bootstrap is the temporary stand-in. Do not run both on one
VM, because they bind the same ports 80, 443 and 8443.

# Initial Deployment Requirements
## Prerequisites for using vmagent

### Setting Up Node Exporter

Node Exporter reports the host's own CPU, memory, disk and network. It runs on
the host rather than in a container, and the host's NixOS configuration installs
and configures it. Nothing here has to be done by hand.

It serves port 9100 over TLS, behind a user name and a password. vmagent mounts
two files from `/etc/node-exporter/`:

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `node_exporter.crt` | The self-signed certificate Node Exporter serves. vmagent mounts it as its CA and skips verification, since it is self-signed. |
| `scrape-password` | The password, owned by host ID `101000`. That is the ID Docker's user namespace maps this stack's vmagent onto. |

Every host has a different password, made on that host the first time it boots
and kept on its persistent disk. A host's vmagent only ever scrapes that same
host's Node Exporter, so the password never has to match between hosts, and no
copy of it exists outside the host it belongs to. That is why
`NODE_EXPORTER_USER` is the only Node Exporter value in this stack's
environment: there is no password for Komodo to hold.

The host's NixOS configuration also opens port 9100, so vmagent can reach it.

## Prerequisites for using dockns

dockns drives two DNS providers per VM:

- **UniFi** (local connector) creates the internal alias so `<service>.<site>.
  myah-mitchell.com` resolves directly to the VM hosting it, on that site's own
  UniFi console. Every VM needs this.
- **Cloudflare** creates the external record for VMs that also host a
  publicly-reachable service (via `cloudflared` + `traefik-dmz`). Most VMs don't
  need this; only ones with a `kop-public`-labeled service meant to be internet
  reachable do.

### UniFi setup (every VM)

1. In that VM's site's UniFi console, generate a local API key with permission to
   manage DNS records (Settings → System → API, or wherever your controller version
   puts it).
2. Set `DOCKNS_UNIFI_HOST` to that console's own local URL, e.g.
   `https://172.16.7.1`, not `api.ui.com`. This is deliberately the local
   connector, not the remote/cloud one: internal DNS management shouldn't depend on
   UniFi's cloud API being reachable, and it keeps the traffic on the LAN. Home-site
   and cloud-site VMs point at their own site's console, so these values differ per
   site, don't copy one site's value to the other.
3. Set `DOCKNS_UNIFI_API_KEY` to the key from step 1.
4. Leave the account/site ID unset unless the console manages more than one UniFi
   site, because dockns auto-discovers the default site.

### Cloudflare setup (only VMs hosting a public service)

Set `DOCKNS_CF_API_KEY`/`DOCKNS_CF_ACCOUNT_ID`/`DOCKNS_CF_ZONE_ID`/`DOCKNS_WAN_IP`,
see [dockns' Cloudflare provider docs](https://codeberg.org/BrenekH/DockNS/src/branch/main/docs/name-servers/cloudflare.md)
for what each value is and where to find it in the Cloudflare dashboard.

# Create and Setup Required Folders

What this stack needs from its host: folders, seed files, and open ports. It is generated from the `setup.yaml` of each container in the stack.

A host gets it from its NixOS configuration. The ansible playbook `nixos-sync.yml` writes this stack's `setup.yaml` into the host's file under `nixos/hosts/` in fleet-private, and deploying the host applies it.

Owners are host IDs. Docker runs with userns-remap, so a container's UID 1000 is host UID 101000. An internal port is open to `docker_stacks_internal_subnet` from the inventory.

The manual steps cover folders and seed files only. The firewall of a NixOS host changes only through its configuration.

## Create Stack Folders

The host's NixOS configuration creates one folder for the stack's logs and one for its volumes.

| Folder | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `/opt/docker/logs/system` | Logs the stack's containers write to files |
| `/opt/docker/volumes/system` | Every other folder in this section |

<details>
<summary>Manual steps, instead of nixos-sync.yml</summary>

```bash
projectName="system"
mkdir -p /opt/docker/logs/$projectName
sudo chmod 750 /opt/docker/logs/$projectName/
sudo chown $USER:101000 /opt/docker/logs/$projectName

mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName
sudo chmod 750 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/
sudo chown $USER:101000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName
```

</details>

## Create needed folders for vmagent

The host's NixOS configuration sets these up when the host is deployed.

| Folder | Owner | Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/opt/docker/volumes/system/vmagent-data` | `101000:101000` | Not set |

<details>
<summary>Manual steps, instead of nixos-sync.yml</summary>

```bash
projectName="system"
mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/vmagent-data
sudo chown 101000:101000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/vmagent-data
```

</details>

## Create needed folders for vlagent

The host's NixOS configuration sets these up when the host is deployed.

| Folder | Owner | Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/opt/docker/volumes/system/vlagent-data` | `101000:101000` | Not set |

<details>
<summary>Manual steps, instead of nixos-sync.yml</summary>

```bash
projectName="system"
mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/vlagent-data
sudo chown 101000:101000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/vlagent-data
```

</details>

## Create needed folders for vector

The host's NixOS configuration sets these up when the host is deployed.

| Folder | Owner | Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/opt/docker/volumes/system/vector-data` | `101000:101000` | Not set |

<details>
<summary>Manual steps, instead of nixos-sync.yml</summary>

```bash
projectName="system"
mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/vector-data
sudo chown 101000:101000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/vector-data
```

</details>

## Open the firewall for vector

The host's NixOS configuration opens these when the host is deployed.

| Port | Protocol | Allowed from | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `5140` | tcp | The internal subnet | Vector syslog |
| `5140` | udp | The internal subnet | Vector syslog |

## Open the firewall for dozzle

The host's NixOS configuration opens these when the host is deployed.

| Port | Protocol | Allowed from | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `7007` | tcp | The internal subnet | Dozzle agent |

## Create needed folders for dockns

The host's NixOS configuration sets these up when the host is deployed.

| Folder | Owner | Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/opt/docker/volumes/system/dockns-data` | `100000:100000` | Not set |

<details>
<summary>Manual steps, instead of nixos-sync.yml</summary>

```bash
projectName="system"
mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/dockns-data
sudo chown 100000:100000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/dockns-data
```
