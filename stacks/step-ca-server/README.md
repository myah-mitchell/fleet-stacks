# Create and Setup Required Folders

What this stack needs from its host: folders, seed files, and open ports. It is generated from the `setup.yaml` of each container in the stack.

A host gets it from its NixOS configuration. The ansible playbook `nixos-sync.yml` writes this stack's `setup.yaml` into the host's file under `nixos/hosts/` in fleet-private, and deploying the host applies it.

Owners are host IDs. Docker runs with userns-remap, so a container's UID 1000 is host UID 101000. An internal port is open to `docker_stacks_internal_subnet` from the inventory.

The manual steps cover folders and seed files only. The firewall of a NixOS host changes only through its configuration.

## Create Stack Folders

The host's NixOS configuration creates one folder for the stack's logs and one for its volumes.

| Folder | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `/opt/docker/logs/step-ca` | Logs the stack's containers write to files |
| `/opt/docker/volumes/step-ca` | Every other folder in this section |

<summary>Manual steps, instead of nixos-sync.yml</summary>

```bash
projectName="step-ca"
mkdir -p /opt/docker/logs/$projectName
sudo chmod 750 /opt/docker/logs/$projectName/
sudo chown $USER:101000 /opt/docker/logs/$projectName

mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName
sudo chmod 750 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/
sudo chown $USER:101000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName
```

</details>

## Create needed folders for step-ca

The host's NixOS configuration sets these up when the host is deployed.

| Folder | Owner | Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/opt/docker/volumes/step-ca/step-ca-data` | `101000:101000` | Not set |
| `/opt/docker/volumes/step-ca/step-ca-secrets` | `101000:101000` | `0700` |

<details>
<summary>Manual steps, instead of nixos-sync.yml</summary>

```bash
projectName="step-ca"
mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/step-ca-data
sudo chown 101000:101000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/step-ca-data
mkdir -p /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/step-ca-secrets
sudo chown 101000:101000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/step-ca-secrets
sudo chmod 700 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/step-ca-secrets
```

</details>

The service runs as `user: ${PUID:-1000}`, and Docker here is configured with `userns-remap: default`, so the container's UID 1000 is host UID 101000. Owning this folder as `1000:1000` gives it to your own login account instead, and step-ca cannot then write to `/home/step`.

## Generate the CA password once

```bash
head -c32 /dev/urandom | base64 | sudo tee /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/step-ca-secrets/password > /dev/null
sudo chmod 600 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/step-ca-secrets/password
sudo chown 101000:101000 /opt/docker/volumes/$projectName/step-ca-secrets/password
```

Do this before the first deploy. Docker creates an empty directory in place of a missing bind-mount file, which makes step-ca fail at startup with nothing obvious to point at. The file lives here rather than in the repo checkout because Periphery re-clones over its run directory, which would take any file written inside it along with it.

This password protects both the root and intermediate private keys at rest (step-ca's own encryption, independent of the extra age/GPG layer applied to the extracted root key below). Store a copy of it in Vaultwarden, and a second copy in the same offline location as the root key backups, outside Vaultwarden. Losing this password after the root key is already offline means losing the ability to ever unlock it again, defeating the whole point of keeping a backup.

## First boot: generate root + intermediate, then verify

```bash
docker compose up -d step-ca
docker logs -f ${projectName}-step-ca   # watch for "Provisioners" / bootstrap-complete output
docker exec -it ${projectName}-step-ca step ca health --ca-url https://127.0.0.1:9000
```

At this point `/home/step/secrets/` inside the container holds both `root_ca_key` and `intermediate_ca_key`. That is only safe for the few minutes it takes to complete the next section, so do it now, before this CA issues anything real.

## Extract and offline the root key (do this immediately after first boot)

This is the one part of Phase 5 that cannot be templated. It is a real runbook, run once, by hand:

1. Copy the root key + cert out of the container (binary-safe, not `docker exec cat`):

   ```bash
   docker cp ${projectName}-step-ca:/home/step/secrets/root_ca_key ./root_ca_key
   docker cp ${projectName}-step-ca:/home/step/certs/root_ca.crt ./root_ca.crt
   ```

2. Add a second, independent encryption layer on top of step-ca's own password-protection (belt and suspenders for a file that's about to sit on a USB stick in a safe / with a trusted third party). Pick a strong, freshly generated passphrase, DIFFERENT from the CA password above, and write it down somewhere durable and NOT solely inside Vaultwarden (see the plan's "Break-glass access" section, same reasoning as every other break-glass secret in this plan):

   ```bash
   age -p -o root_ca_key.age root_ca_key
   ```

3. Copy `root_ca_key.age` + `root_ca.crt` to two physically separate durable locations (e.g. an encrypted USB key in a home safe, plus a second copy off-site, such as a bank box, a trusted person, or anywhere not co-located with the first). Either copy alone is sufficient to recover; no reconstruction ceremony.

4. Wipe every plaintext/working copy from this machine and from the container:

   ```bash
   shred -u root_ca_key root_ca.crt root_ca_key.age
   docker exec ${projectName}-step-ca rm /home/step/secrets/root_ca_key
   ```

5. Confirm the CA still issues certs fine via the intermediate alone:

   ```bash
   docker restart ${projectName}-step-ca
   docker exec -it ${projectName}-step-ca step ca health --ca-url https://127.0.0.1:9000
   ```

## Test the recovery procedure once in a sandbox (an untested backup isn't a backup)

On a throwaway/sandbox machine, decrypt either of the 2 backup copies (prompts for the age passphrase):

```bash
age -d -o root_ca_key root_ca_key.age
```

Re-sign a throwaway intermediate from the offline root. This confirms both the key and the step-ca password backup are actually usable, not just that the file exists:

```bash
step certificate create "sandbox intermediate" intermediate.crt intermediate.key \
  --ca ./root_ca.crt --ca-key ./root_ca_key --profile intermediate-ca
```

Then wipe the plaintext again:

```bash
shred -u root_ca_key intermediate.crt intermediate.key
```

## Traefik internal cert resolver (wiring, unverified)

`containers/traefik/compose.yaml` defines one certificate resolver, `letsencrypt`, and none for this CA. A second resolver pointed at this CA's ACME directory endpoint has not been written. The DNS-01 challenge specifics are not yet confirmed. step-ca's ACME server can issue without external domain-ownership proof since it's a private CA you already control, but the exact Traefik-side resolver flags (challenge type, whether a dnschallenge provider is even needed for an internal-only zone) need real testing against a running step-ca instance before one is added. Don't copy the letsencrypt resolver's DNS-01/Cloudflare config verbatim without checking it actually applies here.

## Root/intermediate trust distribution

Add step-ca's `root_ca.crt` (the public cert, not the key) to the fleet's CA certificates in the inventory. `nixos-sync.yml` writes the list to `caCertificates` in `nixos/fleet.json`, and a NixOS host trusts every certificate in it from its next deploy.
